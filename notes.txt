command is just a program sitting in our PATH folder, whenever we type it shell interprets i.e search for that command in the PATH folders and executes it with option or inputs provided

command structure->

$command -options input

command can also take inputs
e.g cal -A 1 -B 1
and can mix this with the command inputs
e.g cal -A 1 -B 1 12 2019

know command location->
$which command
e.g
$which echo

manual in linux system(divided into 8 section-> user commands, file structure, adminstrative commands..etc)
search in manual
e.g
$man -k which
$man -k "list directory contents"
man MANUALSECTION COMMAND_NAME
e.g
$man 1 which

For 1st section command man just use
or man which

[] => optional in manual pages 
<> => mandotary in manual pages
| => OR i.e you can use either of the two option
... => can use more than once(e.g multiple arguments or inputs)

Few commands dont have man pages,
e.g man cd -> No man found

so there is help command,
$help cd
ouput similar to man page,
so if command is right and man page not there, try search using help command
